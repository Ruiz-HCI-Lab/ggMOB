Horizontal gene transfer mediated by conjugation is considered an important evolutionary mechanism of bacteria. It
allows organisms to quickly evolve new phenotypic properties including antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence. The
frequency of conjugation-mediated cargo gene exchange has not yet been comprehensively studied within and between
bacterial taxa. In this paper, we developed a frequency-based mobilization network of genus-genus conjugation features
and cargo genes, using whole-genome sequence data from over 200,000 bacterial genomes, representing 1,345 genera. Our
results revealed that over half of the bacterial genomes contained one or more known conjugation features that matched
exactly to at least one other genome. Moreover, the proportion of genomes containing these conjugation features varied
substantially by genus and conjugation feature. These results and the genus-level network structure can be viewed
interactively using the ggMOB-Net tool, which allows for user-defined filtering of conjugation features and cargo genes.
Using the network data, we observed that the ratio of AMR gene representation in conjugative versus non-conjugative
genomes exceeded 5:1, confirming that conjugation is a critical force for AMR spread across genera. Finally, we
demonstrated that clustering genomes by conjugation profile sometimes correlated well with classical phylogenetic
structuring; but that in some cases the clustering was highly discordant, suggesting that the importance of the
accessory genome in driving bacterial evolution may be highly variable across both time and taxonomy. These results
demonstrate the utility of the ggMOB-Net tool, which can be used by researchers to further probe genus-genus
mobilization dynamics. ggMOB-Net will be especially useful for generating insights into conjugative mobilization between
unculturable bacteria and complex interactions involving multiple genera, as such insights are difficult to obtain
experimentally.
